# Assignment 07

List and define 5 basic Git terms (e.g., commit, branch, merge, etc.).

1. A commit is a post of your changes in the repository. It records what files were    changed, added, or deleted along with a message to describe what was edited


2.A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
The main or master branch is usually the default branch.

3.Merge is like combining two different sets of changes into one.
Commonly, you merge feature branches into the main branch once the work is complete.

4.A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project lives. 
It's the folder where Git tracks everything.

5.To clone a repository means to create a copy of a remote repo on your local machine.
