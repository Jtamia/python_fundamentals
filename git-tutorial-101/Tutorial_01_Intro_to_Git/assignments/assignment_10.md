# Assignment 10

Write a short paragraph on how Git can help in a team project.

Git makes working on a team project way easier. Everyone can work on their own parts of the code without disturbing each other. You can create your own branch to try out ideas or build features, and then merge everything together when it’s ready. It also keeps track of every change, so if something breaks or you want to see who did what, it’s all there. Basically, it helps the whole team stay organized and in sync, even when a lot of things are happening at once.
